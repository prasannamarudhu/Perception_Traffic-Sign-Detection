# Perception_Traffic-Sign-Detection
This project was implemented to perform the Traffic sign recognition for a given dash-cam road video obtained from ETH-Zurich Vision Lab. There were two major tasks performed viz detection and classification. For the detection stage we chose the MSER algorithm and followed the suggested pipeline in Project guidelines. Once the signs were detected, we extracted the ROI, resized them, extracted features and passed them on to the classifier for identifying the image and showing the interpretation by displaying the image understood by the classifier against the traffic sign.
